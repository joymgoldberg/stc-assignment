                <P>If I were to ask my confreres in graduate school if they could name a literacy activist, they would likely rush to answer, "Paulo Freire". I would have answered the same name too, until I read a book by a literacy activist closer to home: <I>University in overalls: A plea for part-time study</I> by Canadian Alfred Fitzpatrick. Like Paulo Freire, I suspect that Alfred Fitzpatrick would not have described himself as an activist, though both educators lived a life committed to social justice, using education to empower people.</P>

                <P>In 1862, Fitzpatrick was born in Millsville, Nova Scotia. At Queen's University, he studied theology and was ordained a Presbyterian minister in 1892. While at Queen's, Fitzpatrick had become very influenced by the progressive ideals of the Social Gospel Christian movement. Its central belief was: "God was at work in social change, creating moral order and social justice. It held an optimistic view of human nature and entertained high prospects for social reform." (Allen, 2015, para. 1)</P>

                <P>Later, during his travels in North America, Fitzpatrick's ideals were reinforced as he encountered first-hand the poverty and strenuous working conditions in logging camps, mines, and railway lines on Canada's rugged frontiers, where labourers worked and lived in remote and isolated areas. As a Social Gospeller, Fitzpatrick believed that education was a vital tool in reforming social conditions; he decided to leave the ministry and focus on teaching among the labourers on the frontier.</P>

                <P>Fitzpatrick successfully lobbied the Ontario government for travelling libraries, and in 1899 or 1900 established the Canadian Reading Camp Movement to provide mine, lumber, and railway worksites with reading rooms--crude structures made of wooden logs and canvas. By 1902 Fitzpatrick had introduced the concept of a labourer-teacher, whereby university undergraduates would work alongside the labourers during the day and teach at night. At the end of World War I, Fitzpatrick saw new possibilities for his organization, which in 1919 was renamed Frontier College. In his book, University in overalls: A plea for part-time study (1920), he presented his vision of Frontier College as a national institution that would educate people wherever they were. Then, in 1922, the federal government recognized Frontier College as a degree-awarding university.</P>

                <P>Yet, despite Frontier College's claim that it did not overlap with other accredited universities, opposition to the College began to gain traction. The Ontario government exerted intense political and financial pressure on the College, its case hinging on provincial control over education. Then, in 1928, Ontario's grants to the College were halted. Hostility also came from universities, concerned with maintaining their control over the higher-education curriculum and the granting of degrees.</P> 

                <P>Ultimately, Frontier College was forced cede its right to award degrees in Ontario in 1931 and nationally the following year. The struggle for the survival of Frontier College had exhausted Alfred Fitzpatrick, and he resigned as principal in 1933. In April 1936, two months before his death, he was awarded Officer of the Order of the British Empire (OBE).</P>

                <P>As the name implies, the Frontier College brought its instructors to frontiers of Canada--logging camps, mines, and railway lines where labourers worked in isolated, remote regions. As part of the Canadian Reading Camp Movement, Frontier College's instructors participated in the manual work during the day, and taught the labourers to read at night. The reading rooms were crude structures and the books included donated newspapers, magazines, and whatever was on hand.</P>

                <P>Frontier College continues to operate in Canada, although no longer on the frontiers. With funding from government, federal agencies, foundations, and both corporate and individual donors, Frontier College continues its grass-roots literacy crusade in urban and rural settings in provinces across Canada.</P>
